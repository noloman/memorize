// we could do the same thing when it comes to removing an element
// but we have to add that to a different protocol
// because Collection works for immutable collections of things
// the "mutable" one is RangeReplaceableCollection
// not only could we add remove
// but we could add a subscript which takes a copy of one of the elements
// and uses its Identifiable-ness to subscript into the Collection
// this is an awesome way to create Bindings into an Array in a ViewModel
// (since any Published var in an ObservableObject can be bound to via $)
// (even vars on that Published var or subscripts on that var)
// (or subscripts on vars on that var, etc.)
